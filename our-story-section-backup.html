        <h2>Who is VERO?</h2>
        <p>Vero began when we realized we couldn't keep up. Long study nights, heavy training, early mornings, and dark Swedish winters left us exhausted. Coffee wasn't enough. Energy drinks made us feel worse. One late winter evening, we admitted it: There has to be a better way. So we created it. We wanted clean energy that actually lasts—something real that matches the ambition of the people who take it. Today, Vero is more than a bar. It's the energy we always needed, and the energy we believe the world deserves. For the late-night thinkers, early risers, athletes, dreamers, and anyone who refuses to slow down… We are VERO.</p>
